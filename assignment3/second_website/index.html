                        <h3>Join Alex Wright for a conversation on the History of the Web</h3>
                        <p>The most commonly shared design histories tend to fizzle out somewhere in the mid-1990s, unable to reconcile the march of ideas with a new frame for reality: the web. Currently defined by Wikipedia as “a global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the internet,” the World Wide Web is more than twenty years old.  What can its history – and prehistory – teach us about the present? What is its history anyway? And what is history for us now? This series presents different viewpoints on what the web was, what it could have been, and how the future will rewrite the past.</p>
